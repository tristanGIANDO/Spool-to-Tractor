# Spool-to-Tractor
R&amp;D about Tractor and spooling jobs from standalone app

With a week to go before the film's deadline, we were faced with a problem when we launched our batch renders, the scenes were so heavy and with such a wide frame range that they crashed.
So I started to make this tool that allows to get the RIBs already calculated and send them to the farm.
There are a lot of interesting things and I plan to create an interface to manage and spool the shots in standalone.

The goal is to create the .alf file directly through Python and without opening Maya
